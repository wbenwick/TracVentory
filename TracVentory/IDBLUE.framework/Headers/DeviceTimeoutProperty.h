 * DeviceTimeoutProperty is a subclass of ByteProperty.

 *
 * The device timeout (in minutes) is used to turn off the IDBLUE device
 * after a period if inactivity (i.e. the front button not being pressed,
 * or no commands sent to the IDBLUE device). Setting the device timeout
 * to zero disables automatically turning off IDBLUE.
